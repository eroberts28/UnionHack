###   Initial flag ideas

The following four flags are the ones that I presented at Formative. My main feedback that the designs weren't imaginative enough and I really wanted to change that for my Summative hand-in. The main thing that I wanted to look at to change them was to research into the countries of the flags that I am changing. I will also create a flag for a made up place to develop this further.

### 1. 
The first flag I changed was Egypt’s. I changed the complex crest that was in the middle to this symbol which represents the sun god in Egypt. I followed the same colour scheme as the flag to fit in.

### 2. 
For my second design I changed the Philippines flag. I added in a circle with a triangle symbol to represent equality just like the white triangle that is already in the flag.

### 3.
My 3rd flag I changed is for Hong Kong. For this one I only changed the colour as the 5 stars are there to echo those on China’s flag, I changed the colour to yellow to also show the link.

### 4. 
Finally, I altered Canada’s flag. I changed the way the two stripes are facing. As one of Canada’s main values is equality and the symbol for equality is an equals sign, I designed their flag to reflect this.
