# UnionHack

###   Initial flag ideas

The following four flags are the ones that I presented at Formative. My main feedback that the designs weren't imaginative enough and I really wanted to change that for my Summative hand-in. The main thing that I wanted to look at to change them was to research into the countries of the flags that I am changing. I will also create a flag for a made up place to develop this further.

### 1. 
The first flag I changed was Egypt’s. I changed the complex crest that was in the middle to this symbol which represents the sun god in Egypt. I followed the same colour scheme as the flag to fit in.

### 2. 
For my second design I changed the Philippines flag. I added in a circle with a triangle symbol to represent equality just like the white triangle that is already in the flag.

### 3.
My 3rd flag I changed is for Hong Kong. For this one I only changed the colour as the 5 stars are there to echo those on China’s flag, I changed the colour to yellow to also show the link.

### 4. 
Finally, I altered Canada’s flag. I changed the way the two stripes are facing. As one of Canada’s main values is equality and the symbol for equality is an equals sign, I designed their flag to reflect this.

Before starting our Union Hack project we watched a Ted Talk on Vexillology. I found it interesting to learn about the properties a flag should have and getting to look at bad examples of flags to know what to avoid. The key tips I picked up from this were that a flag design should be simple enough that a child could draw it, it should be able to be drawn on a 2cm x 1cm piece of paper (meaning little detail, this is because the average distance a flag will be seen from, it will appear this size) and also that it should contain no more than 3 colours.

### Final flag ideas

### 1.
In this first flag I decided to change Netherlands’ flag. The original design for Netherlands is 3 horizontal stripes: blue, white and red. The red however was originally supposed to be orange. The meaning behind this is based on the heraldic colours (coat of arms) or Prince William of Orange who led the fight for Dutch independence. Including the history, I wanted my flag to have relevance to the Netherlands. The colour scheme of my flag (green & blue) is used to represent the image itself; I used these colours to show the image of a patch of grass and the sky above it. I decided to add in a windmill as after searching Netherlands, what come up most are flowers and windmills due to the countries love for them. After adding the windmill I wanted to implement the history mentioned before, so I made it orange.

### 2. 
The next country’s flag that I altered was Egypt. Just like Netherlands, I wanted my design of the flag to represent what most associate with the country. When I think of Egypt I would think of pyramids, desert, sphinxes and camels. I decided to follow this theme for my first Egypt flag, I added in pyramids and also changed the bottom colour of the flag to a sandy pyramid colour so that it blends in with the pyramid to make it look like land and the top strip as blue to represent the sky. I had the same idea for the second one but I kept the same colour scheme of Egypt’s original flag but added in camels to, to show more of relation to the country as people would automatically associate with it.

### 4. 
Next I looked at China’s flag; this is one of my favourite flags as it stands. The colours that it uses are nice and bright to stand out but also contrast well together. Due to this, I didn’t want to change the colours when I created my version of the flag. I also wanted to keep the stars for this flag as they represent communism (the large star) and the four smaller stars represent the social classes of the people. The first design I wanted to add in The Great Wall as it is an important landmark of China and the world. I designed it with the four stars around the end of the wall to represent the fact that it is there to protect against the raids and invasions which protects all of the social classes that make up China’s population but also the lead into communism with the large star at the end. The second flag idea I had followed the same colour scheme but I have added in a silhouette of a panda as that it where majority of Giant pandas live and are associated with China. I have used the panda to symbolise communism instead of the large star and this being within the 4 small stars. I have done this as by definition communism is a social organisation where all property is owned by the community (in this case, the small stars) representing Chinas society.

### 6 - Flag for a made up place 
For my flag for a made up place I wanted to come up with something quite different that would still fit the simple terms of what a flag should be. After thinking about this I decided to create a flag for a place run by animals. My thinking behind this design is that, unlike people, animals can still see everything clearly in the dark but if we were to see an animal in a pitch black room we would only see their eyes. Because of this I decided to create a black flag with bright animal eyes within it. The main eyes that I featured are cats but also an owl too as both of these animals have piercing eyes in the dark.
